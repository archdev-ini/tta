= TTA Curriculum Management Guide
:toc:
:icons: font

This guide provides technical instructions for adding or updating programs on the TTA platform using the MDX content engine.

== 1. File Location
All program content is stored in the content repository:
`src/content/programs/`

== 2. Creating a New Program
To add a new program, create a `.mdx` file in the directory mentioned above. The filename will become the URL slug (e.g., `quantum-architectics.mdx` becomes `/programs/quantum-architectics`).

== 3. Frontmatter Configuration
Every file MUST start with a YAML frontmatter block. This data controls the logic of the listing page and transitions.

[source,yaml]
----
---
title: "PROGRAM TITLE"
label: "Program / [Status]"
status: "Upcoming" | "Ongoing"
featured: true | false
description: "A short professional summary for the index card."
---
----

=== Field Definitions
* `title`: The main heading (e.g., "LOCKEDIN // 2026").
* `label`: Secondary institutional tag (displayed in small caps).
* `status`: Current state (e.g., "Open Enrollment").
* `featured`: If `true`, the card gets a 5% Coral background tint and a lock icon.
* `description`: The copy that appears on the `/programs` listing page.

== 4. Component Library
You can use the following custom TTA components directly inside your markdown:

=== ModuleBadge
Creates the standard 4-column module grid.
[source,mdx]
----
<div className="max-w-[1600px] w-full border-x border-t border-foreground/5 py-40 grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 bg-dot-pattern">
   <ModuleBadge title="Phase 01" label="Conceptual Logic" />
   <ModuleBadge title="Phase 02" label="Technical Build" />
   <ModuleBadge title="Phase 03" label="Operational Delivery" />
   <ModuleBadge border={false} title="Phase 04" label="Absolute Mastery" />
</div>
----

=== Link
Use for internal or external navigation.
[source,mdx]
----
<Link href="/contact" className="btn-outline">Inquire Now</Link>
----

== 5. Layout Structure
A typical program page should follow this institutional sequence:
1. **Frontmatter**: (Required at top)
2. **Hero Segment**: Managed automatically by the framework.
3. **Operational Section**: A two-column grid (`grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2`) for "Update" and "Parameters".
4. **Module Segment**: Using the `ModuleBadge` grid.

== 6. Deployment
Once the `.mdx` file is saved, the platform will:
1. Automatically add it to the `/programs` listing.
2. Generate the dynamic route at `/programs/[slug]`.
3. Validate the institutional design during the next build cycle.

== 7. Global Settings (Marquee & Sitewide Text)
To edit sitewide strings like the Home Page Marquee, modify the following file:
`src/content/settings/globals.mdx`

[source,yaml]
----
---
marqueeText: "THE THINKING ARCHITECT // MASTERCLASS // <CurrentYear /> // JOIN THE COMMUNITY"
---
----

=== Dynamic Tags
* `<CurrentYear />`: Automatically replaced with the current dynamic year across the platform.
